# DragPage Notes

## todo
- Drag from one box to another with `react-dnd`

## tut steps
- skipping creation of board.
  - assumption that i can apply it to a regular icon drag..
- 1 setup drag and drop context
  - provider needs to be set up "near" the top of our app... how near?
  - I'll try right below the main redux provider
- 2 define drag types
- 3 make knight draggable
- 4 make square droppable
- 5 add drag preview image
- 6


- failed to hook up the drag correctly.
- not seeing the problem and errors are too ambiguous.
- next attempt will follow the chess example more closely.
